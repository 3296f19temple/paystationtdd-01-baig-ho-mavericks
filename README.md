## PAYSTATION PROJECT - DESCRIPTION AND FEATURES

The Purpose of the project was to work in a team and contribute the code already provided by adding test cases and fixing some of the code. The Paystation takes money from clients to sell them parking tickets that allows them a certain amount of time bought. The PayStation takes payment of a nickel, a dime, and a quarter, it also executes or cancels transactions if asked to.
The following are the test cases which were implemented:
  
  1-Call to empty returns the total amount entered. 
	2-Canceled entry does not add to the amount returned by empty. 
	3-Call to empty resets the total to zero. 
	4-Call to cancel returns a map containing one coin entered. 
	5-Call to cancel returns a map containing a mixture of coins entered.
	6-Call to cancel returns a map that does not contain a key for a coin not entered. 
	7-Call to cancel clears the map. 
	8-Call to buy clears the map.
  
Each team-member was expected to show contribution to the project by commiting.
